# Robotics_Projects
A collection of projects using ROS and a 6-axis UR3 robotic arm

Lab 2: Tower of Hanoi pick and place with manually inputted points <br/>
Lab 3: Forward Kinematics using intrinsic robot parameters and specified robot angles <br/>
Lab 4: Inverse Kinematics that calculates the correct joint angles to achieve a desired end effector position <br/>
Lab 5: Pick and place using OpenCV and blob detection <br/>
